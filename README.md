# Aim: 
To explore and understand the various prompting techniques used for generating videos using AI-powered video generation models and platforms.

# Algorithm / Procedure:
## 1. Familiarize with AI Video Generation Models:
Explored and studied the functionality of popular AI-based video generation tools including:

 * Runway Gen-2 – known for generating realistic videos from text prompts.

 * Synthesia – widely used for AI avatar and presenter-based video generation.

 * Pictory – designed for summarizing long-form content into short videos.

 * DeepBrain – effective for generating corporate-style AI avatar videos.Each model’s strengths and limitations were analyzed in terms of video quality, duration, realism, and customization.

## 2. Create Simple Prompts for Initial Video Generation:

 * Example Prompt: “A person walking in a park.”
Generated a basic video that visually interpreted the subject and action.

## 3. Use Detailed Prompts for Enhanced Visual Quality:

 * Example Prompt: “A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them.”
This yielded more expressive visuals with additional environmental elements.

## 4. Add Time and Motion Elements:

 * Example Prompt: “A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing colors in the sky.”Successfully added temporal progression and camera movement to the video narrative.

## 5. Test Different Video Styles:

 * Example Prompt: “An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people.”Explored animated and artistic styles, revealing that prompt style significantly affects aesthetic and tone.

## 6. Iterate and Refine Prompts:

 * Initial Prompt: “A car racing through a city at night.”

 * Refined Prompt: “A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase scene.”Observed that adding cinematic language and details improved realism and scene dynamics.

## 7. Generate Multiple Variations:
 * Created multiple versions of the same concept (e.g., varying camera angles, weather, or clothing of characters) to evaluate how slight prompt changes affect the output.

## 8. Save and Compare Outputs:
 * Saved each generated video and compared the effects of prompt structure, tone, and detail on the final video.

## Result:
The experiment was successfully executed. It was observed that detailed, structured, and context-rich prompts consistently produced higher-quality and more coherent videos, while basic or vague prompts led to generic or limited visuals. The experiment validated that effective video prompting requires clarity, creativity, and iterative refinement.
